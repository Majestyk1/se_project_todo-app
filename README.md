# Simple Todo App

A simple to-do app that helps you organize, prioritize, and track tasks effortlessly.

## Functionality

This project focuses on refactoring a simple to-do app built with JavaScript, transitioning it from a procedural programming style to an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. The to-do app allows users to manage their tasks effectively, including functionality to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and organize using dates.

## Technology

The refactoring process will involve encapsulating the app's functionality into classes and objects, which makes the code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
